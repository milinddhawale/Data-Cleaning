## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for data-cleaning tasks. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline, ensuring that datasets are accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. This toolkit includes a collection of scripts, notebooks, and resources to streamline and automate the data-cleaning process.

In this data cleaning process, there are so many things included such as:

Missing values can occur for various reasons, such as data entry errors, equipment malfunctions, or intentional omissions. Dealing with missing values is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of analyses and models.
